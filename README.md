# E-Commerce-Site_Back-End
Module 13: To build the back end for an e-commerce site. Take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Node.js and MySQL to your pc. Can also install Insomnia to view the local host functions.
3. Within the terminal, run npm install to install the required packages within the package.json file. 
4. Run "node server.js" within the root file. The "http://localhost:3001" will be usable once the node server.js states "App listeneing on Port 3001!"

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a functional Express.js API
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Usage
* The purpose of this application is to show the funtionality of Express.js API. It also shows the combination of sequelize functions being run to create a personalized API. Once the database has been built with seeded SQL data, we are able to access and manipulate that information within our local host using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE functions coded with javascript. 
* This type of application is useful in that it provides a guideline on how to create APIs. With this data, one can use it for the next step of creating a fullstack website.
